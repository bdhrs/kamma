# Kamma

Lightweight, cross-tool workflow management for AI coding CLIs.

*Kamma* a Pāḷi word for action, work, doing.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/kamma:0-setup` | Scaffold a project with project.md, tech-stack.md, workflow.md |
| `/kamma:1-plan` | Create a new thread (feature, bug fix, chore) with spec + plan |
| `/kamma:2-do` | Implement the selected thread until it is ready for independent review |
| `/kamma:3-review` | Review an implemented thread with an independent agent or tool |
| `/kamma:4-finalize` | Mark a reviewed thread complete, sync docs, and handle cleanup |
| `/kamma:5-status` | Show progress overview of all threads |

## Supported Tools

| Tool | Format | Invocation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Claude Code | TOML commands + plugin.json | `/kamma:0-setup` |
| Gemini CLI | TOML commands + gemini-extension.json | `/kamma:0-setup` |
| Antigravity | Global workflows | `/kamma-0-setup` |
| OpenCode | MD with frontmatter | `/kamma-0-setup` |
| Kilo CLI | Skills (SKILL.md) | Skill-based activation |
| Codex CLI | Plain MD prompts | `$kamma-0-setup` |

## Usage

### Workflow

Kamma now follows a four-step execution flow for each thread:

1. `/kamma:1-plan` creates the thread spec and implementation plan.
2. `/kamma:2-do` implements the thread and stops at review handoff.
3. `/kamma:3-review` performs structured review, ideally with a different agent or tool.
4. `/kamma:4-finalize` marks the thread complete, syncs docs, and handles archive/delete cleanup.

### Edit prompts

Edit any file in `commands/`. This is the single source of truth.

### Sync

```bash
uv run python scripts/sync.py
```

Or use:

```bash
./sync.sh
```

This is just a thin wrapper around the same `uv` command.

The sync tool copies prompts to all supported AI CLIs that are already installed on your machine and skips the rest.

### What it creates in your project

When you run `/kamma:0-setup` in a project:

```
your-project/
└── kamma/
    ├── project.md          # What the project is
    ├── tech-stack.md       # Languages, frameworks, tools
    ├── workflow.md         # Task lifecycle rules
    ├── threads.md          # Master index of all threads
    └── threads/
        └── <thread_id>/
            ├── spec.md     # What to build
            └── plan.md     # How to build it
```
